# Legal-Description-Comparer
Made this to help my dad with some stuff for his work.

Since legal descriptions are so flowery, I made this to check if two of them are the same or not. It just compares two strings, returns true if they're the same and false if they're not.

Work in progress, I plan on adding more features and making the GUI smoother.
